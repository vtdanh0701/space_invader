### Description  
For our first project deliverable, I built a version of Space Invader, a space shooter arcade game. Player controls a spacecraft and shooting at enemies when they spawn. When enemies get killed,they will drop bonus items for you to collect. There are 2 kinds of bonus, one gives you 100 points and one gives you attack speed. As the player attack speed increase to a certain point, player bullet will be upgraded ( more bullets ). There are also boss being summoned every 30 seconds, when you kill the boss, you go to the next level. As the level goes up, enemies hp and speed will be increased.When player get hit by enemies or enemy's bullets, it's game over. Player can try to play again to beat the highscore or end game.
